# parachutist-problem-eulers-method
C++ script that uses Euler's method to approximate the velocity of a falling parachutist given the size of each time interval, the initial time, the final time, the initial velocity, the mass of the parachutist, and the drag coefficient. This script was written as part of a Computer Science course on numerical methods.
